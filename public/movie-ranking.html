<h1>The Best Movies According to Kian Zhong</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>It is a feel-good movie about a middle-aged man trying to break out of his comfort zone to find a new 
    meaning to life. I watched it during a time of immense pain and it provided me with comfort.</p>

<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>Superhero action movie that started the entire MCU and Robert Downey Jr. What more can I say?</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>A surprisingly entertaining action film filled with gore and violence. Recommended for father-son 
    bonding time.
